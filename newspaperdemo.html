<p style="font-size: 20px">Day after Friday’s blowup between Donald Trump and Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the Oval Office, Russia’s foreign ministry termed Ukrainian President’s visit to Washington DC a “complete diplomatic failure of Kyiv”.
“The visit to Washington on February 28 is a complete political and diplomatic failure by the Kyiv regime,” Kremlin Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said in a written statement published on Saturday on the ministry’s website.
Zakharova further added that the Ukrainian president is “obsessed” with prolonging the war and added that Moscow’s goals remain “demilitarisation” of Ukraine and annexation of all territories currently occupied by Russia.“With his outrageously rude behaviour during his stay in Washington, Zelenskyy confirmed that he is the most dangerous threat to the world community as an irresponsible instigator of a major war,” Zakharova claimed.In recent days, Moscow had grown uneasy as Trump appeared to take a more pro-Zelenskyy stance, following diplomatic visits to Washington by the leaders of Poland, France, and Britain, who urged continued support for Ukraine. Trump had even hinted at backing European peacekeepers in Ukraine—an idea seen by Kyiv and its allies as crucial to preventing Moscow from reigniting the war, as it had after previous ceasefires.
Nevertheless, any Kremlin concerns quickly dissipated when Zelenskyy found himself politically cornered by Trump and Vice President JD Vance.
“The White House will now start looking more closely at other candidates for Ukraine’s presidency,” wrote Alexey Pushkov, a member of the upper house of the Russian parliament, on Telegram, The Guardian reported.Regime change in Ukraine has long been a key objective for Putin, who has made no secret of his desire to see a Moscow-friendly leadership installed in Kyiv.<br>However, President Putin has yet to make any official comment on the Oval Office meeting that plunged ties between Kyiv and the United States to a new low.</p> <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/M8pExFtxZz4?si=PlfvCpiNbhoRyPCA" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe><br>
