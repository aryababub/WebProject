# WebProject
A task‑management web application built with Python (Django/FastAPI) and a React frontend. It enables users to register, create tasks, and get contextual task‑suggestions powered by a GPT‑based service. Tasks are synced in real‑time across devices, complete with notifications and analytics dashboards.
