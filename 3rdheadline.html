<p style="font-size: 20px">Former Pakistan cricket legend Inzamam-ul-Haq has joined Saqlain Mushtaq in criticising the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) over the ongoing Champions Trophy controversy.

The dispute emerged when England cricket experts Nasser Hussain and Mike Atherton pointed out that the Indian team gained an 'undeniable' advantage by playing all their matches at a single venue in Dubai.The Indian government's decision not to allow the national team to travel to Pakistan due to political tensions and security concerns led the ICC to schedule all India's matches in Dubai.
<br>"Keep aside the Champions Trophy. Top players participate in IPL but Indian players don't participate in other leagues. Other boards should stop sending their players to IPL. If you (BCCI) don't release your players for leagues, then other boards should take a stance," Inzamam said in an appearance on a Pakistani TV channel.

BCCI's policy prevents Indian players from participating in overseas leagues unless they retire from Indian cricket, including IPL and domestic tournaments. These retired players cannot return to BCCI-hosted events.

<br>The venue controversy took an unexpected turn as both Australia and South Africa travelled to Dubai to prepare for a potential Champions Trophy semi-final against India.The final group match between India and New Zealand will determine the semi-final lineup. Both teams have already qualified for the next round.The situation has led to both Australia and South Africa arriving in Dubai for preparation.
